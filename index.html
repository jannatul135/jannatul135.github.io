      <p>Hello, my name is Jannatul Hakim, and I am currently
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at
        the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. My academic
        journey has fostered a deep appreciation for problem
        solving, software development, and harnessing
        technology to streamline processes and enhance user
        experiences. I chose UWM because of its strong emphasis
        on innovation and the computer science program’s
        rigorous curriculum, which includes algorithm design, data structures, software engineering principles, and
        hands-on project work. </p>

      <p> My core interests span full-stack web development, back-end engineering. I am proficient in languages like
        Java
        and Python, experienced with frameworks such as Django
        and Spring Boot, and comfortable working with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout
        my
        portfolio, you will find examples of projects that highlight my abilities to develop efficient systems, write
        clean code, and collaborate effectively with peers.</p>

      <p> My ultimate career goal is to work in software development or IT consulting, where I can apply these skills to
        real-world challenges and create meaningful, impactful solutions. Thank you for visiting my ePortfolio, and I
        invite you to explore the various sections to learn more about my professional growth, technical expertise, and
        ongoing projects.</p>
